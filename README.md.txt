Hello all,

It’s a little dream of mine to create a simple snake game o/, just like the one I used to play on my mom’s cellphone. 
I’ll start by developing it in Python and maybe later in Java, as these are the languages I’m currently studying. 
And yeah, I’m more of a back-end developer, but who knows? Maybe in the future, I can try to design a cute layout for it.

First try using Copilot: It works just fine, but not as good as I was expecting, so I'll try again with this course:
